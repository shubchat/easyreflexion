# Running Reflexion on Human Eval

This is a repo which contains a methodology to build build [Reflexion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366) as a flow engineering technique  for the HumanEval problem solving dataset
described in the paper "[Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on
Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374)". Though this is not an exact replication of the reflexion methodology it works on the same principles of making LLMs self-relective by using tests as evaluation.

## Installation

Make sure to use python 3.7 or later:
```
$ conda create -n codex python=3.7
$ conda activate codex
```

Check out and install this repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/openai/human-eval

```

## Usage



**Run Reflection**
```
Python3 main.py
```

To evaluate the samples, run
```
$ evaluate_functional_correctness samples_reflexion.jsonl
